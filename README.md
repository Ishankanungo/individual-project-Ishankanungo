## Problem Statement

The order should satisfy the given requirements, and if it does, a bill amount should be generated. If the order does not satisfy the requirements, an output file, stating the limitaion should be generated.

## Instructions to run the program
1. Create a folder by cloning the repo in which all the files are present.
2. Change the current directory to the file location
3. Move the current directory to the src file
4. Type in: javac ExecuteOrder.java
5. Next Type in: java ExecuteOrder

## Design Patterns Used:
1. Singleton: The singleton design pattern is used to fetch the datasets inside CustomerOrder File. The program is supposed to fetch multiple dataset files, therefore singleton design pattern is used to implement that.
